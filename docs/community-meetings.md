## Jesters and Stewards

Raider Roundups and Roundtables are coordinated by:
* Stewards: manages notes, slides and emcee scheduling
* Jesters: emcee for meetings assigned

Stewards help coordinate the underlying processes of Raid Guild while the Council of Jesters take turns providing cohesive and directed conversations.

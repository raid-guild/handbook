Before we get down and dirty, you should know that Discord is the central communications hub for all things Raid Guild.  With that in mind, there are some things you should know before you jump into the Discord and get involved.

When communicating with Raid Guild members in the Discord, it is of utmost importance that you are mindful of and respect other members by remembering the following: 

1. Do not spam channels by duplicating posts.
2. Do not spam members by tagging @Raid Guild Member more than once weekly.
3. Do not join or attempt to join member-only meetings unless invited.
4. Make your best effort to post material in channels that are relevant to the purpose of your post.
5. Engage in constructive communication with fellow Raiders, and this includes being respectful of the ideas or opinions of others even though you may disagree with them.

Raid Guild made [wrapeth.com](wrapeth.com), and you can use it to wrap your xDAI into wxDAI. Wrap Eth is super-minimal, and if you prefer to see confirmation and success messages on the page you could try [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap) instead.

## 1. Add the wxDAI token to your Gnosis Chain wallet

* Copy the token address for the wxDAI token. (See table below)
* In MetaMask, switch over to Gnosis Chain and click Import Tokens, then paste in the token address and wait for the rest of the fields to fill automatically.

| Field | Value |
| -------- | -------- |
| [wxDAI token address](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0xe91D153E0b41518A2Ce8Dd3D7944Fa863463a97d/token-transfers "Wrapped xDAI token on blockscout.com")     | 0xe91D153E0b41518A2Ce8Dd3D7944Fa863463a97d    |

## 2. Wrap your xDAI to make wxDAI

### Use Wrap Eth to wrap your xDAI 

* Go to [wrapeth.com](wrapeth.com) and connect your wallet. Make sure you’ve selected the Gnosis Chain netowrk in MetaMask.
* Select Wrap xDAI and enter the amount to wrap. (Don't wrap 100% of your xDAI; leave enough to pay for gas fees)
* Click Submit, and approve the transaction in MetaMask.
* Watch MetaMask notifications for completion of the transaction.
* Check your wallet for the wxDAI.
